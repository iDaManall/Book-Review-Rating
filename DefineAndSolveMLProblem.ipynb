The label will be a new column we will create called \"Review Score\" which quantifies the sentiment of the review further than just a simple binary classification. This would be a supervised learning problem since we have the \"Positive Review\" column that labels the true \"sentiments\" of the reviews which we will reference to when creating initial data for \"Review Score\", and then use that data in order to train/assess our model for new unseen data. This would be a multi-class classification problem with the options being on a scale of 1 to 5. We will be deriving our features from the text in the \"Review\" column that will be transformed into numerical representation using TF-IDF vectorization. This is an important problem because it can effectively indicate whether a product/person/or anything else will be well received or not and track public opinions in a sense. It gives deeper insights rather than just a binary classification, which may provide better feedback and improvements. They can also assess each user's individual preferences by their reviews and recommend books based on that. "

    "Now that we have inspected our data, the plan is to introduce a new column called \"Review Score\" that will store a number between 1-5 to quantify the sentiment analysis and provide more depth. Our feature list will consist of the review text, and positive score which is used in creating the review score labels and won't be used in model training. We won't need vader score since review score covers that roughly nor our label column.  \n",
    "First, we will clean our data such as the \"Review\" column and transform it into numerical representation so we can actually use the data more effectively. We will do this by applying common pre-processing practices such as changing everything to lowercase, removing stop words, lemmatization, etc. Then, we'll apply TF-IDF vectorization to change the text into numerical features. We will keep this new Review data for training. In order to populate \"Review Score\" we will use a sentiment analysis tool and some thresholds to convert them to a 1-5 scale. If we find the data to be unbalanced we will use resampling techniques such as upsampling and downsampling.\n",
    "We can use a multi-layer neural network model with an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. We can also add dropout layers to prevent overfitting. \n",
    "To train our model, we will utilize the accuracy metric, sparse_categorical_crossentropy for multi-class classification, and the adam optimizer with a lower learning rate. We will also have a learning rate scheduler that will dynamically change the learning rate to prevent overfitting. In addition to this measure to prevent overfitting, we will also have an early stopper callback. Class weights will be utilized to ensure that the model is training properly and all labels are trained properly. With all these parameters in place, we can compile and train our model. We can then evaluate the model and get a classification report. Additionally, we can print out the reviews, predicted score, and actual scores to visually see our model in effect. "
